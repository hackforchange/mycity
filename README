= Hacking for Change and Social Good

The MyCity project was built in 24 hours at the Hack for Change hackathon.

MyCity is a social issue notification system for helping the right people
know about issues in your neighborhood.  It could be anything from graffiti
on walls to dangerous intersections that need upgrading.

The project includes an iPhone App for adding issues.
